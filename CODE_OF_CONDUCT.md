# Code of Conduct

## Our commitment

We are committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone who participates in this project and its community.

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces (including GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and reviews) and to project-related events (including office hours, webinars, and hackathons).

## Expected behaviour

We expect all participants to:

- Be respectful and considerate in tone and wording.
- Assume good intent and focus on constructive, technical discussion.
- Be mindful that written communication can be misinterpreted—ask clarifying questions.
- Welcome newcomers and support learning.
- Respect different viewpoints and experiences.
- Give and receive feedback gracefully.

## Unacceptable behaviour

Unacceptable behaviour includes, but is not limited to:

- Harassment, intimidation, or bullying in any form.
- Discrimination or hateful conduct (including based on protected characteristics).
- Sexual harassment or unwelcome sexual attention.
- Threats of violence, encouragement of self-harm, or incitement.
- Sustained disruption of discussions (e.g., derailing, spamming, or trolling).
- Doxxing or sharing someone’s personal information without consent.
- Retaliation against anyone who reports a concern or participates in an investigation.
- Publishing private communications without consent.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and when an individual is representing the project or its community. This includes:

- GitHub repositories under this project
- Issues, pull requests, discussions, comments, and reviews
- Project documentation and community channels
- Office hours and other project events (virtual or in-person)

Reports are reviewed by the maintainers.

If you believe there is an immediate risk to someone’s safety, contact local emergency services first.

## What happens after you report

Maintainers will:

- Acknowledge receipt as soon as reasonably possible (where contact details are provided).
- Review the report and assess appropriate next steps.
- Treat reports as confidential to the extent possible, sharing information only as needed to address the issue.
- Take action to prevent ongoing harm and reduce the risk of recurrence.

We may not be able to share full details of outcomes, particularly when doing so could compromise privacy or safety.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including (but not limited to):

- Asking for an immediate stop to harmful behaviour
- Content removal (editing/deleting comments, issues, PRs, or discussions)
- Warnings
- Temporary participation restrictions (timeouts)
- Temporary or permanent bans from project spaces and events
- Escalation to relevant organisational channels where appropriate

## Events

Project events are expected to follow this Code of Conduct. Note that office hours are not recorded. Please do not record or share screenshots/quotes from events without consent.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is informed by the Contributor Covenant and common open-source community practices.
